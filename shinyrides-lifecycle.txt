Implementation
	- The process of building the product and preparing it for production
	- Actually build the thing
	- Put pen to paper
	- Work together to meet the requirements

Testing
	- Trying all the different use cases of the project to ensure they work correctly according to the requirements
	- The process of verifying the product and making sure it is ready to go in to production.

Getting the budget for the project

Three things about design:

Creating diagrams for the systems needed for the solution
Brainstorming for the solution

Three things about implementation:
